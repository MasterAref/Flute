# Flute

** _With Flute you be able to download voice files from Linguee.com site._ **

## Why?
Currently i am learning new language and using Anki to create flash cards.

I think its good when reviewing files also hearing pronouniations.
so i each of my cards there is a field for voice.
But i found copying each file's path and manually downloading it its time-consuming,
so i though creating Flute in order to help me and hope it help you too :)
